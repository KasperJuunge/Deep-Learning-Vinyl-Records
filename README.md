# Vinyl Records and Deep Learning
The main project in the course "Deep Learning" at Technical University of Denmark. The objective is to make a convolutional neural network tell a vinyl records release decade based on its album cover art. The input is an image of a vinyl record cover and the output is a decade (60s, 70s and 80s). The data used to train this CNN is gathered using the discogs_scraper scrip written i C# which can be found on my GitHub.
