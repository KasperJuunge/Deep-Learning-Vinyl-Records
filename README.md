# Vinyl
Main project in Deep Learning course at DTU. Objective is to make a convolutional neural network tell a vinyl records genre based on its album cover. So the input is an image of a vinyl record cover and the output is a genre. The data used to train this CNN is gathered using the discogs_scraper scrip written i C# which can be found on my GitHub.
